ðŸ’¯ Score calculator for geofindr games

Calculation of the score of a GeoFindr game, from a list of latitude / longitude coordinates.

The score formula is as it follows:
- 1000 pts for any distance below 10 meters
- 0 pts for any distance above 1000 kilometers
- 1000 - log(distance - 9) * 500 / 3 in all other cases

This means that to get half the points or more, you need to place your answer 1 km or nearer of the refercence point.
